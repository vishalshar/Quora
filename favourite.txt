+ What is something people need to understand?

    Grit is the engine of success.
    Not ability.
    Not talent.
    Not IQ.
    Grit.
    This isn't a matter of opinion. There's research behind it. And what it concludes is unequivocal—
    Innate aptitude just means you start out a few steps ahead.
    Perseverance is where it's at.
    When I started out my writing was so crappy I wouldn't share it here if you paid me.
    My first gig paid $1.5/hour.
    10,000 hours later, I support a family of 5 by working from home.
    I got here because I showed up.
    Every. Single. Day.
    Ask my wife how many times I came to her on the verge of tears saying I wanted to quit because my writing was rejected.
    But I stuck with it.
    And with time, the rejections became approvals.
    Never hearing from clients again became high-paying long-term retainers.
    And the feelings of insecurity became a steadily growing sense of self-assurance.
    Failure is staying down after you get knocked out.
    Success is doing something as many times as it takes until you nail it.

+ What is it that nobody tells you about adult life?
http://qr.ae/TUNdBY
    My grandfather used to say, “If you’re persistent, you’ll get it. If you’re consistent, you’ll keep it. And if you’re grateful, you’ll attract more of it.”
    Never get tired of changing your good to better and your better to best.
    You no longer have a blame list of why you can't where you want to be.
    Some men get married not because they needed companion but just so they could have a 'sex toy' at home because they see women as a property they own. To every women out there who desire a blissful, prosperous & happy marital life, may yall never encounter such men.
    Hardest thing to accept is the fact that we always want what's perfect when we aren't perfect ourselves.
    
 + What's an absolute 'must learn' for twenty-somethings?
 http://qr.ae/TUGWrO
 1 Learn WHO You Are

Before you learn ANYTHING else, learn WHO you are.
I know this sounds a little bit cliche, but it really isn’t.
I don’t mean that you need to “find yourself”, I mean that you need to silence the noise and the mental clutter until you can figure out who you really are at your core.

    What are YOUR goals and dreams (not your friends, family’s, or society’s)
    What is your learning style?
    What are you “naturally” good at
    What do you suck at
    What do you love to do? What do you hate?
    What are your biggest weaknesses (ignore and outsource these if possible)
    What are your biggest strengths (go all in on these)?

Take some time to really figure out who you are and how you operate.
Take personality tests. Figure out your learning style. Learn about cognitive biases and mental traps that you might fall into.
When you know who you are, everything else becomes easier.
We all share the same DNA, but the 1% variance between us and other human beings leads to HUGE changes in how we live our lives and operate on a daily basis.
“Know thyself” and the world will be your oyster.

2. Learn HOW to Perform at High Levels Consistently

If you want to make a fortune, work less than your peers, and enjoy the highest quality of life possible, the FIRST skill that you must master is not marketing, sales, or online advertising.

It’s high performance.

Simply put, you must learn HOW to get more done in less time while avoiding burnout if you want to thrive in today’s economy.
Here are a few basic tactics to get you started:

    Exercise for 30 minutes every single morning (something that works up a sweat but doesn’t drain you)
    Eat an 80/20 whole foods diet
    Get blood work done and identify micro-nutrient deficiencies
    Use the Pomodoro method while working (50 minutes of work, 10–15 minutes of rest)
    Take 1 whole day off each week
    Sleep 8 hours a night
    Plan your days the night before and have clear goals for every block of work or study

This is a bare bones list that will help you perform better and be more productive, but I highly recommend that you check out the following resources too…

    Peak Performance by Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness
    The Productivity Project by Chris Bailey
    High Performance Habits by Brendon Burchard
    Awaken the Giant Within by Tony Robbins
    The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg
    Psycho-cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz

These are just a few to get you started, but if you can only optimize ONE thing in your life… This should be it.

3. Learn at Least ONE Highly Marketable Skill Set

The next thing you should learn after developing self awareness and the ability to perform at high levels is a marketable skill.
For example:

    Copywriting
    Website design
    Sales
    Content creation and marketing
    Coding
    Social media marketing
    Product creation

Any skillset that can be applied to dozens of businesses that MOST people aren’t good at is what you’re looking for here.
I know copywriters who are so good at what they do that they charge more than $50,000 for a 2,000 word sales page.
I know sales experts pulling a 7-figure salary.
I know social media marketers with 8-figure agencies.
You don’t need to know everything.
You just need to be a MASTER at one skill and an EXPERT at 2–3 others (i.e. you’ve put 1000 hours+ into skills that compliment your main skill).
I can’t tell you WHICH skill you should pursue (after all that’s part of knowing yourself) but I can tell you that if you will commit to ONE high level high income skill for the next 5 years, you will never have to worry about money again.

4. Learn the Nuances of Social Dynamics and Networking

It’s not what you know it’s who you know.
This might be an old cliche… But it’s true.
My network has helped me improve my business, secure more deals, and grow my net worth more than any book or program ever has.
I highly recommend that you spend a significant amount of time learning the nuances of persuasion, seduction, social dynamics, and negotiation.
You don’t have to have ANY other skills to succeed in life if you can persuade others.
I interviewed a guy named Steve Sims who used to work as a nightclub bouncer.
Today, he runs a multimillion dollar international luxury concierge service where he helps people do the impossible. Things like:

    Getting a private submarine tour of the Titanic
    Getting married in the vatican… By the pope
    Meeting Elon Musk and Richard Branson
    Having Guns and Roses play a private concert for a friends birthday party

And a whole lot more.
He’ll tell you himself, he’s not smart or gifted at anything other than connecting with people and negotiating good deals.
And he’s a mega millionaire because of it.
Learn this skill and your life will change forever.

5. Learn How to Be an F’ing Adult

Exercise regularly. Follow a budget. Invest money. Go to the dentist when you need to. Keep your house clean. Stop watching porn. Do more than play video games.
Just learn to be a a damn adult.
Too many people are running around looking like they’re 40, acting like they’re 12, and thinking like they’re 15.
Don’t be one of those people.
Learn to grow up and be an adult.
Life is easier when you are better.
End of rant.
Hope this helps.
