+ What is something people need to understand?

    Grit is the engine of success.
    Not ability.
    Not talent.
    Not IQ.
    Grit.
    This isn't a matter of opinion. There's research behind it. And what it concludes is unequivocal—
    Innate aptitude just means you start out a few steps ahead.
    Perseverance is where it's at.
    When I started out my writing was so crappy I wouldn't share it here if you paid me.
    My first gig paid $1.5/hour.
    10,000 hours later, I support a family of 5 by working from home.
    I got here because I showed up.
    Every. Single. Day.
    Ask my wife how many times I came to her on the verge of tears saying I wanted to quit because my writing was rejected.
    But I stuck with it.
    And with time, the rejections became approvals.
    Never hearing from clients again became high-paying long-term retainers.
    And the feelings of insecurity became a steadily growing sense of self-assurance.
    Failure is staying down after you get knocked out.
    Success is doing something as many times as it takes until you nail it.

+ What is it that nobody tells you about adult life?
http://qr.ae/TUNdBY
    My grandfather used to say, “If you’re persistent, you’ll get it. If you’re consistent, you’ll keep it. And if you’re grateful, you’ll attract more of it.”
    Never get tired of changing your good to better and your better to best.
    You no longer have a blame list of why you can't where you want to be.
    Some men get married not because they needed companion but just so they could have a 'sex toy' at home because they see women as a property they own. To every women out there who desire a blissful, prosperous & happy marital life, may yall never encounter such men.
    Hardest thing to accept is the fact that we always want what's perfect when we aren't perfect ourselves.
